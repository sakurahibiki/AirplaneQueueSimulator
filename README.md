# Airplane Queue Simulator

This is a simple **airplane queue simulator** written in **Java**. The simulator models the queue of airplanes waiting to land or take off at an airport.

## Features

✅ Developed a simulation of an airport queue system using queue data structures and an **interactive GUI**.  
✅ Simulates airplane queuing based on FIFO (First-In, First-Out) logic.  
✅ Integrated **time tracking**, multiple **airport terminals**, and a **flight processor** to help manage departures and landings efficiently.  
✅ Added features such as **View All** (displays queued flights) and **Run** (processes flight schedules dynamically).  
✅ Utilizes **file handling** and **CSV import/export** to store and retrieve airplane queue data.  
✅ Built with **Java** using **NetBeans**.
